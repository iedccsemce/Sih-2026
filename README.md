# 🚀 SIH 2026 Submission Template using GitHub Actions

This repository provides an **automated workflow** to manage **SIH 2026 project submissions** using **GitHub Issues & Pull Requests**.

## 📌 Features

- **Issue-Based Submissions** – Participants submit their projects via **GitHub Issues**  
- **Automatic PR Creation & Updates** – Converts issues into PRs and updates them if edited  
- **Submission Validation** – Ensures required fields exist in `submissions.json`  
- **Deadline Handling** – Marks late PRs with `[LATE]` and adds appropriate labels  
- **Automatic Merging** – PRs are merged when their associated issue is marked **completed**  
- **Clone Submitted Repositories** – Saves all valid submissions inside the repository

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Submitting a Project

1. Participants create a **GitHub Issue** using a predefined template.
2. If the issue is labeled **`project-submission`**, a PR is automatically generated.
3. The PR contains submission details and links to the participant's GitHub repository.

### 2️⃣ Validating & Reviewing

- PRs are checked for **missing fields** in `submissions.json`
- PRs **submitted late** are marked with `[LATE]` in the title and given the label `late-submission`
- Reviewers can approve and merge valid submissions

### 3️⃣ Automatic PR Merging

- If an issue is **marked as completed**, its associated PR is automatically merged.
- The project is then added to `submissions.json` in the repository.

### 4️⃣ Cloning Repositories

- Once a submission is merged, the workflow **clones the participant's GitHub repository** into the **`Submissions/`** folder.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Deadline:** The current submission deadline is **September 10, 2026, 7:00 PM IST**. Update the deadline in `config.yml` at the root of the repository to change it. The workflow reads the deadline from this YAML config file.
- **Late Submissions:** PRs submitted after the deadline will be marked with `[LATE]` in the title and the `late-submission` label. Reviewers can still approve and merge late submissions, but they will be clearly marked.
- **Template Format:** The workflows require the issue template format to remain unchanged. If you modify the template, update the extraction logic in the workflow accordingly.
- **Repository Cloning:** Only public repositories under 100MB will be cloned. Private or oversized repositories will be skipped, and maintainers will be notified of any failures.
